Was not feeling in the mood this morning, so struggled to push through a basic task. The tailwind syntax sometimes makes things a little confusing. Need to work on the Tailwind to CSS syntax script.

**Creating Styleguide: 05/02/19 1Hr 30m**

Had to create the main styleguide html layout from scratch.

Also needed to create the font size variables and classes, this needs to be optimised.

Line height grid and the fonts line up nicely. Adding padding seems to work as a way to get fonts to sit nicely.
