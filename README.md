## Responsive approach

**Black Sidebar + Reveal Button**

Hide black sidebar on mobile. Which is activated by reveal button in header. Reveal button is hidden on desktop.

**Main head of search input**

On mobile search input is hidden but revealed with icon of magnifying glass. On desktop it is displayed in full view.

**Creating Styleguide: 05/02/19 1Hr 30m**

Had to create the main styleguide html layout from scratch.

Also needed to create the font size variables and classes, this needs to be optimised.

Line height grid and the fonts line up nicely. Adding padding seems to work as a way to get fonts
to sit nicely.
